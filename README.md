# adversary — a Model Meets Reality starter

**attacks a common belief and names what would refute the attack**

A *model* here is not neural weights. It is a short document stating premises, a
mechanism, at least one falsifiable consequence with a date, and a deletion
clause naming when you would retire it. This repo is a starting point for one of
the eleven kinds.

## What makes this kind a kind

**Premise shape**

```
<Common belief> is wrong because <mechanism>. It would survive if <specific observation>.
```

**What would prove it wrong:** the belief under attack survives the specific test named





**Tier: PROVEN** — a discipline worked out against real instances.

## Agentic reasoning

Models here are not static documents. The engine runs each one against live
sources on a schedule: it searches, reads what it finds, and writes dated claims
that later get graded. Every citation is validated against what the search
actually returned, so a fabricated source is dropped rather than recorded.

What the pass asks is specific to this kind:

> State the belief under attack and the specific observation that would vindicate it. An adversary that cannot be refuted by the thing it attacks is not doing its job.

And when a claim comes due:

> Did the attacked belief survive the test this model named?

## Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shaelsrv/ModelMeetsReality my-copilot   # the engine (anonymous clone, no gh CLI needed)
cd my-copilot
rm -rf .git               # detach: a clone still points at the engine's remote
git config --global --add safe.directory "$PWD"   # if git says "dubious ownership"
git init && git add -A && git commit -m "main instance"
cp .env.example .env      # set OPENROUTER_API_KEY, or LLM_BACKEND=claude-code

python -m suites.new_model my-model --kind adversary \
    --title "My Model" --domain "what it models, in a sentence"

# then EDIT ../my-model/watch.json -- the scaffold placeholder is refused
# and write real premises into MODEL.md; the scaffold is empty by design
python -m suites.model_watch --repo my-model --predict
```

The engine refuses to run against the scaffold placeholder, on purpose: running
it as-is spends a web search and returns either nothing or claims about a target
you did not choose.

`rm -rf .git` matters: a fresh clone is already a git repo whose `origin` is the
engine, so without it the `git init` is a no-op and a later `git push` would send
your private premises to the engine repo. Your main should be yours — one initial
commit, no remote.

## Engine

Pinned to `56a33c1` of [ModelMeetsReality](https://github.com/shaelsrv/ModelMeetsReality). The engine
is shared across all eleven kinds; only the discipline above differs. Update
deliberately rather than tracking latest.
